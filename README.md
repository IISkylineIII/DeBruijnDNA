### De Bruijn Sequence Generator
This script generates a De Bruijn sequence of order n over an alphabet of size k. A De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible k-mer of length n appears exactly once as a substring. This is commonly used in bioinformatics and DNA sequencing simulations. 

### Usage
The function de_bruijn_sequence(k, n) generates a De Bruijn sequence for a DNA alphabet (A, C, G, T) truncated to the first k characters.

```
# Example: Generate a 4-universal string (for all 4^4 = 256 possible 4-mers)
result = de_bruijn_sequence(4, 4)
print(result)
```
### Example Output
AAAACAAAGAAATAACACCACGACTAGAGCAGGAGTAGT...


### Requirements
Python 3.x

No external libraries are required (pure Python standard library).


### ApplicationsThis script can be applied to:

* Bioinformatics: Generate universal k-mer strings used in DNA sequence analysis and error correction.
* Synthetic biology: DNA barcode design and experimental optimization.
* Computer science: Graph theory, combinatorics, and efficient testing of string patterns.
* Genomic simulations: Exhaustive testing of pattern-matching algorithms using all possible k-mers.
